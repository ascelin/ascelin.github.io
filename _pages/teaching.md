I teach within the [Sustainability and Urban Planning program][SUP-link] in the [School of Global, Urban and Social Studies][GUSS-link] at [RMIT University][RMIT-link].

I'm currently lecturing [Environmental Processes and Change][ENVI1211-link] (a first year subject) and [Environmental Management and Assessment][ENVI1049-link] (a third year subject). 

I'm also the Program manager for two degrees: The [Bachelor of Environment and Society][bp000-link] and the [Bachelor of Environmental Science/Bachelor of Environment and Society][bp193-link] double degree. If you're a student in either degree and would like organize to meet with me, you can contact me using [this program manager email address](mailto:bp000.pm@rmit.edu.au) or book yourself an appointment to see me in person of via a Teams chat using this [link][pm-bookings-link].
