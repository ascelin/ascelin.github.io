I see meditation and contemplative practice as an ongoing explorarive process that can enrich our lives in many ways. As well as reducing stress levels and allowing us to be more grounded, if we let it, contemplative practice can facilitate new ways of experiencing the world and give us much needed space and perspective to examine the way we live, and the implications of our daily activites.

Having praticed meditation for over 20 years, in 2024 I completed a meditation teacher training with the [Melbourne Meditation Centre](https://melbournemeditationcentre.com.au/meditation-courses/meditation-teacher-training/). 


I run a weekly mindfulness meditation session from 12-1pm on Mondays. The session runs concurrently online and in person (at the RMIT city campus). While the sessions are open to all RMIT staff and students, anyone interested is also welcome to join online. Please contact me [here](mailto:ascelin.gordon@rmit.edu.au) to find out more and see [this link](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/support-and-facilities/student-support/chaplaincy/events-and-activities#mindfulness){:target="_blank"} for further details (click on "Chaplaincy events").
