I see meditation and contemplative practice as an ongoing explorative process that can enrich our lives in many ways. As well as reducing stress levels and allowing us to be more grounded, if we let it, contemplative practice can facilitate new ways of experiencing the world. It can also give us much needed space and perspective to examine the way we live, and the implications of our daily activities.

Having practiced meditation for over 20 years, in 2024 I completed a meditation teacher training with the [Melbourne Meditation Centre](https://melbournemeditationcentre.com.au/meditation-courses/meditation-teacher-training/){:target="_blank"}, with the plan to offer meditation and contemplative practice events in 2025. I'm most passionate about the intersection of mindfulness and nature connection, and plan to explore this further via my outdoor [Guerrilla Meditation](https://www.facebook.com/GuerrillaMeditation){:target="_blank"} group. 

At RMIT University, I run free weekly meditation sessions from 12-1pm on Mondays that are open to all staff and students. Sessions run concurrently online and in person at the [RMIT Multifaith & Wellbeing Centre](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/support-services/health-safety-wellbeing/chaplaincy){:target="_blank"}, located in [Building 47 (8 Orr St, Carlton)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5eDcauGDjj3ALMFW6){:target="_blank"}. While in person attendance to these sessions is open to RMIT staff and students, anyone interested is welcome to join online. Please contact me [here](mailto:ascelin.gordon@rmit.edu.au) to find out more and see [this link](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/support-and-facilities/student-support/chaplaincy/events-and-activities#mindfulness){:target="_blank"} for further details (click on "Chaplaincy events").
