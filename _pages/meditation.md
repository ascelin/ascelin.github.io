I run a weekly mindfulness meditation session from 11-12pm on Mondays. The session runs concurrently online and in person (at the RMIT city campus). While the sessions are open to all RMIT staff and students, anyone interested is also welcome to join online. Please contact me [here](mailto:ascelin.gordon@rmit.edu.au) to find out more and see [this link](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/support-and-facilities/student-support/chaplaincy/events-and-activities#mindfulness){:target="_blank"} for further details (click on "Chaplaincy events").
