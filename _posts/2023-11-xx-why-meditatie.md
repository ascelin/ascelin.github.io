Why Meditate? 

For my first blog post on the topic of meditation, I thought I'd tackle the question of why bother meditating at all... 


Self help benefits. 

Getting to know ourselves. When we sit still with our eyes closed, there is very little to discract us from ourselves. All there is is ourself, and we are doing nothing else but being with it. Most of what we are experiencing are our thoughts, the sensations of body and eventually experiencing our own awareness as distinct from our thoughts. We can experientially discuver that we still be present and aware even when we're not thinking.  


Getting a new perspective on *everything*. Take time out and be still, allows you to come back see things differently
