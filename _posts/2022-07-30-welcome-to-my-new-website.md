I wanted to share a few recent papers on topics related to biodiversity offsetting. The first came out just recently and explores the need for registers to allow transparent reporting and evaluation of offsets and offset policies. The second argues for the need to retain biodiversity gains from offsets over the long-term, and the third is an exploration of how the concept of 'no net loss' and offsetting evolved through time and discourses that have been used to promote it. There is a more detailed description of each papers below (I've attached the pdfs too).
