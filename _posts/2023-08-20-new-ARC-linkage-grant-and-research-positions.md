I recently found out that a [Linkage Grant](https://www.arc.gov.au/funding-research/funding-schemes/linkage-program) proposal I led was successful funded by the [Australia Research Council (ARC)](https://www.arc.gov.au/). It was titled "More than a reserve? Measuring the benefits of private protected areas".

This is exciting news! It's an interdisciplinary project looking to measure the ecological, socio-cultural, and economic benefits generated by private protected areas (PPAs) in Australia to both human and non-human beneficiaries. The ARC Linkage Program is designed to fund academic research that is of direct relevance to industry partners, and the partners in this case are the following organisation, who either own or coordinate PPAs:

 * [Bush Heritage Austraia](https://www.bushheritage.org.au/)
 * [Birdlife Australia](https://birdlife.org.au/)
 * [Trust for Nature]()
 * [Australian Land Conservation Alliance](https://alca.org.au/)

The research team is as follows:

 * [Ascelin Gordon](https://ascelin.github.io/) (Lead Chief Investigator, [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/))
 * [Katie Moon](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/katie-moon) (Chief Investigator, [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/))
 * [Sayed Iftekhar](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/25772-md-sayed-iftekhar) (Chief Investigator, [Griffith University](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/))
 * [Kerrie Wilson](https://www.qut.edu.au/about/our-people/academic-profiles/kerrie.wilson) (Chief Investigator, [Queensland University of Technology](https://www.qut.edu.au/))
 * [Rebecca Spindler](https://www.bushheritage.org.au/who-we-are/people) (Partner Investigator, [Bush Heritage](https://www.bushheritage.org.au/))
* [James Fitzsimons](https://www.natureaustralia.org.au/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/james-fitzsimons/) (Partner Investigator, [The Nature Conservancy Australia](https://www.natureaustralia.org.au/))
 
I'm looking forward to working on a project that combines researchers with a conservation science/ecology background (Wilson, Spindler, Fitzsimons) with a social scientist (Moon) and an environmental economist (Iftekhar).

The project will also involve employing several new researchers. This includes a Post-Doctoral Research fellow for three years and full time PhD student (both to be based at RMIT University). In addition, there are funds to employ a part-time social science research assistant (to be based at UNSW) and a part-time environmental economics research assistant (to be based at Griffith). I'll be making a separate post specifically about these new positions soon. But for now please [get in touch](https://ascelin.github.io/contact/) if you are interested to find out more about any of these positions.
